## Lesson 1: Introduction to Spring Boot 

### 11. Recap

* Build web apps with Java and Spring Boot.
* Learn what a Java web server is and how to build applications for it with Spring.
* Present our applications on the web with Thymeleaf and Spring MVC, and we'll connect to a database to store user data with MyBatis.
* Learn how to secure our website with Spring Security and test it with JUnit and Selenium.

Together, these skills are going to allow us to build secure, maintainable, and reliable web applications with ease. You'll be capable of taking on any web development scenario with confidence, especially one that involves registering and authenticating users, storing user-submitted data, and allowing the user to access and edit their data through a web site. Something like a file-storage app, perhaps?
