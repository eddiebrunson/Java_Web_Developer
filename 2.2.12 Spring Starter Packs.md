## Lesson 2: Web Developement in Java

### 12. Spring Starter Packs

Spring is a collection of open-source libraries that solve common web development problems. But how do we get those libraries? In this course, we'll be using Maven, a dependency management tool that lets us define dependencies on open-source libraries based on their names and version numbers. We define those in a file in our projects called `pom.xml`, which Maven reads and uses to download the required libraries. We can also have our projects inherit dependencies from some base project, which is a feature that Spring Boot uses to make setting up a new Spring project easy as pie. We'll be using Spring Initializr, an online project generator, to choose specific Spring dependencies to add to new Spring projects.

Spring Boot is best experienced with the help of Spring Initializr, an official project generator. You can use it to configure metadata and build properties of a project as well as what starter dependencies you want to include. These include:

* [Spring Dev Tools](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.5.16.RELEASE/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html): utilities including hot reloading changed code into a running application
* [Spring MVC](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html): web layer utilities that make developing server-side web apps easy
* [Spring Data]https://spring.io/projects/spring-data): a common interface for many different types of database access
* And [many more](https://spring.io/projects) Once you've selected your dependencies and chosen your language, build tool, and project identifiers, Spring Initializr will generate a zip file that includes a ready-to-run server with all of the choices you made reflected in its `pom.xml` file, as well as the package structure.

### Key Terms
* **Maven**: A dependency management system and project build tool for Java. Provides a standardized way to define dependencies between projects and include them in the project build path.
* **POM**: The **P**roject **O**bject **M**odel that Maven uses to represent the dependency and build configuration of a project. Usually, this refers to the `pom.xml` configuration file found in a Maven project.
* **Dependency Management System**: Any tool that automates the downloading and linking of external packages to a software development project. Most languages these days either provide one officially or have a community-accepted standard.
