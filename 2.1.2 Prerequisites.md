# 2. Spring Boot Basics

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Spring Boot 

### 2. Prerequisites 

To get the most out of this course, you should already be familiar with the basics of Java, SQL, and IDEs.

If you're looking to get started with Java, Udacity has a free [Java Programming Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282) course, which as a bonus introduces IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE. Another resource is the Java Tutorials from Oracle. These are also an excellent reference, especially if you're already familiar with another language and just need to know what's different in Java. That being said, we do expect you to be very familiar with Java in this course, so proceed at your own risk if you're attempting to come here from another language!. If SQL is a no for you: check out Udacity's free [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) course, where you'll learn both to design and query SQL databases.

If IntelliJ IDEA is new territory, you can take a look at their [feature overview](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/) to get a sense of what's possible. Note that we will be using the open-source Community Edition of IntelliJ in lessons. If you want to pay for the Ultimate Edition, you are free to, but it is not required. If IDEs are new to you entirely, check out the last lesson of Udacity's free [Java Programming Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282) course for an introduction.
