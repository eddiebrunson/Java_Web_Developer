### 7. History

___

Networked computing has existed for nearly sixty years. First, specific programs were designed to speak to each other, but over the years several standards for different data protocols were established. In this era, the server/client dichotomy reigned supreme, with specialized server and client programs developed for individual network tasks like file sharing and email exchange. This changed with the development of the world wide web, HTTP, and HTML. As web sites became more complex, the web servers took on more and more roles as the mediator between the user's browser and other relevant services. This amalgamation of web server responsibilities coincided with the release and popularity of Java, which was soon accompanied by official web servlet and application container specifications which solved common problems when constructing complex, feature-rich web servers.

With the rise of the web, software developers began to meet and share ideas in open source communities online. These groups developed useful tools and utilities, including Spring, which aimed to build on Java's rich server architecture and provide a boilerplate-free enterprise development experience. It has grown into an industry standard, and an umbrella project that supports a vast array of powerful utilities and frameworks.
