## Lesson 2: Web Developement in Java

### 1. Web Development in Java


### Lesson Outline
In this lesson, you'll be introduced to the following ideas and tools:

* Java Application Servers: We introduce the basics of server-side web development and how a Java Application Server simplifies things.
* Java Servlets: We discuss the central feature of the Application Server, the Servlet, and how it allows developers to access the conveniences provided by the Application Server.
* Spring Applications: We introduce Spring Framework, a collection of Java libraries and tools that build on the Application Server and Servlet to provide a huge amount of utility to Java web developers.
* Spring Starter Packs: We discuss the various "starter packs" available through Spring Boot's project generator, which can be used to quickly get up and running with a new Spring Boot project configured for specific features.
* Maven and the POM file: We introduce Maven, a dependency management tool for Java that allows developers to easily use powerful open-source libraries in their projects. We discuss how dependencies are declared in Maven's pom.xml file.
