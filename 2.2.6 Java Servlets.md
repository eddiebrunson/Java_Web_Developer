## Lesson 2: Web Developement in Java

### 6. Java Servlets

The `Servlet` class is the main connection between the apps you develop and the application server they run on. By extending `Servlet`, you can create endpoints that handle incoming requests in a way specific to your application needs, and you can map specific request URLs to specialized servlets by adding entries to a `web.xml` file. The app server uses this configuration to instantiate and manage your servlets. It interacts with each through three standard methods, `init`, `service`, and ``destroy`:

`service` is where requests are handled, and the server will call this method when a request is routed to the servlet it's called on.
`init` is where initialization of the servlet is handled, and the server will call this method directly after instantiating the servlet.
`destroy` is where servlet resource cleanup is handled, and is called directly before the server terminates the servlet instance.

### A quick note on Java Application Files:

When you compile a Java program and package it to be run, the Java compiler creates what is called a **J**ava **AR**chive, or JAR file. This file contains a compressed file hierarchy, with folders that represent Java packages that contain Java .`class` files, which are the compiled versions of `.java` source code files. It can also contain arbitrary resource files, either at the root level or deeply nested in the package hierarchy. These files often contain metadata related to the app or library contained in the JAR file, which can be read by any program that interacts with the JAR.

When you want to deploy an app to an app server, you have to package it as a **W**eb application **AR**chive, or WAR file. A WAR file is almost identical to a JAR file, but includes configuration files specific to web applications. When we copy a WAR file into the deployment directory of an app server, the server unpackages it, looks for a `web.xml` file, and uses that file to find the classes and resources required by the application. This uses advanced Java features like reflection and class loading to programmatically load Java class definitions and instantiate them which is quite a nifty trick! It allows us to dynamically load, start, stop, and replace any number of applications in a web server at any time.

### Key Terms
* **Endpoints**: An endpoint is the address at which a client can reach a specific part of a server's functionality. Usually, this is a URL path, the `/words/and/slashes` that follow the domain of a URL, like `.com` or `.org`.
* `Servlet`: A class defined as a part of the Java: Enterprise Edition specification. Provides an implementable interface for web server request processing, defining a `service` method that the server invokes on an instantiated servlet to handle a `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse` object for an incoming request. The servlet also defines lifecycle methods for the server to invoke when initializing or destroying a servlet.
* **JAR**: A Java Archive file, which stores compiled `.class` files in a folder hierarchy that matches the code's package structure. Includes an optional manifest file.
* **WAR**: A variation on the JAR for web applications, which optionally includes web resources like HTML files and configuration files like `web.xml` for servlet registration/mapping.
