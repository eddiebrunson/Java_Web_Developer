## Lesson 3: Spring Boot Basics for Web Development 

### 8. Solution: Components and Services 

There are quite a few classes in this example, but only some of them need annotations. WE can figure out which ones by following the chain of dependencies - `FoodController` references FoodService which references `FoodRepository`, which means all of them need some variation of`@Component` on each. Yes, even FoodController at the top of the chain - remember that in order for Spring fill dependencies, all related components must be configured for IoC.

We also need to annotate our main application class with `@SpringBootApplication`. Remember that this is what configures Spring's component scanning and auto-configuration, so without this, the `@Component` variants we used above wouldn't be seen by Spring.

### Course1ExercisesApplication.java

```java
/**
* This annotation will, among other things, enable component
* scanning for our project
*/
@SpringBootApplication 
public class Course1ExercisesApplication {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
     SpringApplication.run(Course1ExercisesApplication.class, args);
  }

}
```

### FoodController.java

```java 
/**
* Controller for receiving requests.
* This class needs to be a Spring Component so that Spring can
* automatically create instances of it to receive web requests. We use
* the @Controller annotation variation of @Component for this purpose.
*/

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/food")
public class FoodController {

   private FoodService foodService;

   public FoodController(FoodService foodService) {
       this.foodService = foodService;
   }

   @GetMapping
   public String getHomePage(FoodForm foodForm, Model model) {
       foodService.addFood(foodForm.getFoodName(), foodForm.getCalories(), foodForm.getMealTime());
       return "foodAdded";
   }

}

```

### FoodService.java

```java
/**
* Food Service that performs business logic operations regarding food
* This class needs to be a component, because our Controller has a reference to
* it that it doesn't create itself. Marking this as a @Service lets Spring know
* to make instances of this bean available to other classes, though @Component would work as well.
*/
@Service
public class FoodService {
   private FoodRepository foodRepository;

   public FoodService(FoodRepository foodRepository) {
       this.foodRepository = foodRepository;
   }

   public Boolean isFoodAvailableAtMealTime(String foodName, MealTime mealTime) {
       return foodRepository.getFood(mealTime).stream()
               .filter(food -> food.getName().equals(foodName))
               .findFirst()
               .isPresent();
   }

   public void addFood(String foodName, Integer calories, MealTime mealTime) {
       foodRepository.addFood(mealTime, new FoodData(foodName, calories));
   }

   public FoodRepository getFoodRepository() {
       return foodRepository;
   }

   public void setFoodRepository(FoodRepository foodRepository) {
       this.foodRepository = foodRepository;
   }
}
```

### FoodRepository.java

```java


/**
* Pretend repository implementation
* This class needs to be a Spring component as well, because our FoodService relies on it. We use
* the @Repository annotation here to denote its function, but for this example @Component would work just
* fine as well.
*/
@Repository
public class FoodRepository {
   private Map<MealTime, List<FoodData>> foodDatabase = new EnumMap<>(MealTime.class);

   public List<FoodData> getFood(MealTime mealTime) {
       return foodDatabase.getOrDefault(mealTime, new ArrayList<>());
   }

   public void addFood(MealTime mealTime, FoodData food) {
       foodDatabase.getOrDefault(mealTime, new ArrayList<>()).add(food);
   }
}


```
