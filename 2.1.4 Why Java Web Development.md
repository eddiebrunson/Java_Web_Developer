### 4. Why Java Web Development 

---

Learning web development is valuable because it's how the digital apps and services that we use every day are built. Being able to visualize the architecture of a web application will make you a better developer and give you tools to use when turning an app idea into reality.

Learning Java is valuable because it's a widely-used industry mainstay, and it has a massive community of developers and open-source projects, like Spring Boot. Learning Spring Boot matters because it's a core Java library that supports and defines language-wide best practices. Mastery of Spring will make you an excellent Java developer and expose you to the Java-standard solutions to a wide range of common problems. Learning to recognize those common problems will make you a better developer. Wherever you go, whatever language you use, the same problems will arise, and you'll know what kind of solutions to look for.
