### 5. Components and Services

If we want to declare custom classes as Spring Components, the best way to do it is to make use of`@ComponentScan`, an annotation that tells Spring to search your code base for classes annotated with `@Component`. These classes will automatically be instantiated as Spring beans, so there's no need to define an `@Bean`-annotated method if you already have @Component on you classes. There are other variants of `@Component` that identify specific roles for each component to play. We'll see some examples of these in the coming lectures, but if you want to learn more, check out the link below.

One important thing to keep in mind is that `@ComponentScan` only marks the package of the class it's annotating for scanning - any classes outside of that package or its subpackages will be excluded by Spring.

### Key Terms
* **Onion Architecture:** An architectural pattern in which an application is separated into nested layers. In order for a request to be processed by the application, it must first travel through an outer layer of external interfaces and controllers, then through a middle layer of services and business logic, and finally through a persistence layer of data access objects. The separation of these layers emphasizes clean separation of concerns.
**Application Component**: In Spring, this is any @Component-annotated class that is instantiated by Spring and placed in Spring's application context. Architecturally speaking, this is a logical unit of an application - a single-purpose library or object that solves a particular problem an application faces.
* **Service**: In Spring, this is any `@Service`-annotated class, handled identically to an `@Component`-annotated class. The difference between the two is semantics - a component is the most generic type of bean, and can be any kind of shared application structure. A service is specifically a collection of library methods that manage one aspect of an application's business logic. For example, a `UserService` would expose high-level actions related to the users of an application, and an `AuthenticationService` would expose actions for registering and authenticating a user. Services represent the middle layer of an onion architecture, and should contain the bulk of an application's business logic.
* **Repository**: In Spring, an `@Repository`-annotated class is treated identically to an @Component-annotated one, but as with `@Service`, the semantics are different. In an onion architecture, repositories are the inner layer - each repository should act like an interface to a specific set of stored or persistent data. For example, a ``UserRepository` would expose an interface capable of create/read/update/delete and query operations on the `users` table of the database.
