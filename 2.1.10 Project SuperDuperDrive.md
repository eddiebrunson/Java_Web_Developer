## Lesson 1: Introduction to Spring Boot 

### 10. Project: SuperDuperDrive

For the final project of the course, you're going to put all of your skills to the test to build a fully-functional web app with Spring Boot. You'll be developing a personal storage app that allows users to store files, personal notes, and website credentials securely for a new company in the cloud storage business, **SuperDuperDrive**. You'll have some help, in the form of a database schema and website prototype HTML files provided by your tech lead at the company. You'll be responsible for developing the registration, login, and data storage features of the application, as well as writing tests to verify the app is feature-complete.
