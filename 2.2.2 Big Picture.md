## Lesson 2: Web Developement in Java

### 2. Big Picture 

A web server's primary role is listening for HTTP requests and handling them with application logic, sending an HTTP response to the client that indicates the result of the operation. Simple HTTP servers host directories of HTML files directly, sending files in response to requests for specific URLs. This is enough for static websites with no dynamic server operations, but modern web apps support users accounts, complex interactions, and persistent data. Java application servers make these features more accessible by hosting many individual applications, managing them over a common interface, the servlet. This allows developers to focus on application logic and features, with HTTP request handling and routing handled by the server.

Spring provides additional sets of libraries that integrate with the servlet interface to provide applications with even more utilities that focus on database access, security, and HTML generation, and it's the tool we'll use to build our web applications.
