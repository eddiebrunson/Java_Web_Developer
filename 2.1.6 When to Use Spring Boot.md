When deciding if the topics you will learn in this course are a good fit for a project you're working on, consider your environment, project features, and testing goals.

If you feel comfortable with Java and your environment supports it, it's a great language for any size project. But if you need ultra-high performance, a bare-metal language like C, C++, Rust, or Go might be a better choice.

If your project aims to connect simultaneous users on different clients, you probably need to build a server, which Spring Boot can help with. If you're making a website with dynamic data, Spring Boot provides **Thymeleaf** as an HTML template engine. If you store and manage data in a database, Spring Boot supports a plethora of Java libraries that provide database access, including **MyBatis**, which we cover in this course. As long as you need a server, Spring Boot is probably the right choice.

If you need to test your application by automating a web browser, **Selenium** is the industry standard. There are libraries for many languages to use Selenium, and Java is one of them. Selenium also has integrations with Spring Boot that make testing server behavior a breeze.
