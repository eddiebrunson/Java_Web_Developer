### 16. Edge Case: When You Can't Use Spring Boot

Sometimes, it's not an option to use Spring Boot in a project. Usually, this is because some form of IoC has already been implemented, or it would take a lot of time to rewrite the code to use Spring Boot. Sometimes, though, it's worth adding Spring or Spring Boot to a project by refactoring the code and adding the Spring Servlet manually. More information on this can be found in the Further Research section, but this won't be a focus for the course - just remember that it takes a decision and some setup to use Spring in an application, and not all applications do!
